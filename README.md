Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis


## Random Forest Classifier
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
- [Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
- It is supervised learning algorithm.

### Pros of Random Forest Classifier
- It is very accurate algorithm.
- It is robust to outliers and nonlinear data.
- It is highly scalable to any dataset size. It can handle large datasets.
- It can handle missing values efficiently.
- It can be used for feature selection.

### Cons of Random Forest Classifier
- It can be computationally expensive when you have a lot of trees.
